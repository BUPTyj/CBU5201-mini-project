 A story is an adventure at the old bookstore. On the leaves of sunny afternoon, I was wandering endlessly on the street. By accident, I turned into a rather out of the way alley. The alley was filled with an old smile and as if time had slowed down there. Suddenly, an old basketball came, an old bookstore came to me.
