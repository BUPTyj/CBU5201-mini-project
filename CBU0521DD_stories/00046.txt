 About when we go go, I took a trip to Ainer to see my best friend from high school. There's someone ahead and seen for a really long time. Ainer is such a wonderful place. The sun is shining brightly. The beaches are low and sunny, and the wind feels so good. Aphelian law is the big blue sea right away. My classmates and I spent a lot of time walking.
