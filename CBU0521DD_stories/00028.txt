 In 2020, I went to Sydney to visit an old friend I hadn't seen in over 10 years. We had reconnected online during the pandemic and talked a lot about how much we missed hanging out in person. So as soon as it was safe to travel, I booked a trip. When I arrived, my friend met me at the airport with a huge hug.
