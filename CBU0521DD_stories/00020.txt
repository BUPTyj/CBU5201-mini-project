 When I was in middle school, I joined a cultural exchange program that took me to the United States. It was my first time chowling abroad, and I was a boast-never and excited. Our trip lasted two weeks, and during that time we visited several cities, universities and famous landmarks. One of the most memorable experiences was visiting Harvard University.
