 In May of this year, I went to a concert on my favorite idol. It was the first time I traveled alone to a foreign country just for a long awaited appointment. The decision was made in a hurry. I made up my mind only a month or so before the concert and I had to prepare all the things for going abroad by myself. It was a stressful and anxiety.
