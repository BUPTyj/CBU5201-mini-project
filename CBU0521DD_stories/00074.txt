 Not a summer, I visited in my cousin who left near the beach. It was well of the best locations I have ever had. My cousin's horse is in a small town by the sea. Very great and peaceful. When I arrived, the first scene I noticed was the fresh sea and the sounds of the waves my cousin was waiting for me.
