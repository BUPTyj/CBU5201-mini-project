 Last summer, I visited a small island with my friends and it turned out to be one of the most exciting trips I've ever had. The island was known for its crystal clear waters and vibrant coral reefs. But what exactly called our attention was the cliff jumping spots and locals recommended and always being a little free to pass by my friends.
