 In night of the day, I traveled to Chicago for a walk meeting. It was my first time visiting the United States and I felt both excited and the best, scared, scared. The flight was long, but I enjoyed looking out of the window and sinking about a venture ahead. When I landed at O'Hare Airport, I took a taxi.
