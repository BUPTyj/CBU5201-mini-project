 Last summer, I visited Boston for a short getaway. It was my first time in this city, and I was excited to explore history and culture. I started my trip by walking the Freedom Trail, a path that takes me to a few songs of most historic sites in the city. Along the way, I saw a famous pro-rev, a reverence house and old north turf.
