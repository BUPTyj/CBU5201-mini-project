 When I went to the school, I went on a trip to Innan. It was supposed to be a very happy holiday. But after revisiting Shangri-La and returning to Quming, my young brother suddenly developed an air infection. I really love the beautiful scenery of Innan, especially Shangri-La. We spent the first two days in there.
