 Back in 2020, I went to visit my cousin in New York. I had been so excited about this trip because I hadn't seen her in years, and I'd never been to New York before. I spent weeks planning everything from the places we'd visit to the restaurants we'd try, but from the moment I landed, things started to go wrong. First, my flight was delayed by almost 6 hours.
