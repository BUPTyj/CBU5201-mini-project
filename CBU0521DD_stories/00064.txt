 In the summer of early mid-June, I had the operational to visit San Francisco, a city known from its culture and the Sonny National Building. It was my first time in California and I was eager to explore everything the city had to offer. I arrived in San Francisco on a sunny morning and the first thing that struck me was an unawks' clueless gate-bird. a torrent over the bikeways.
