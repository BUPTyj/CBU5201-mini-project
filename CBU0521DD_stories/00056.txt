 Few years ago, I visited London with a group of friends. While exploring the city, we stumbled up in a narrow alley lined with all brick walls and I've recovered artists. At the very end of the alley was a small, almost-hidden bookstore. It's wooden sign, barely legible, from where. Read the silent page. Currently, got the better of me and I stabbed it.
