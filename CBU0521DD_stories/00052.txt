 It was an autumn afternoon. I returned to my childhood town to Sima Grand Lala, whom I had been in for years. The town was lively and the same yet it felt both familiar and night. The streets, the cooler cafe and the row of houses along the main road were all still over there, but quieter and slower than my memories.
