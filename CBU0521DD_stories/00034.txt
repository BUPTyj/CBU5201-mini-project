 Last year, I planned a trip to Paris to attend the opening of a renowned art gallery showcasing the work of my favorite artist. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I had been preparing for months. I had carefully saved up, purchased tickets well in advance, and planned every detail of the journey. The gallery was scheduled to open.
