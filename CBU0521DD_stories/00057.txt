 Looking back at my childhood travel, I came to Tibet in the early 12th, where I was in force with this old son, as well as the most magical experience. It was my first time traveling to such a unique space. And even now, almost a year later, the memory reminded me my mind. I remember all my dad came and reminded me to look slowly because of the altitude.
